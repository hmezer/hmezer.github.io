Welcome to my personal website, hosted with **GitHub Pages**!  
This site is a showcase of my personal projects, all built using **plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**—no frameworks or libraries.

## About

I'm passionate about web development and enjoy building things from scratch to truly understand how the web works.  
This portfolio highlights my commitment to simplicity, performance, and learning by doing.

## Projects

Here you'll find a collection of my projects, including:

- **Mini web apps**  
- **Interactive experiments**
- **Responsive layouts**
- **UI components**
- **Useful tools**  
...and more—all created without frameworks or build tools.

## Why Plain HTML/CSS/JS?

- **Performance:** Lightweight sites load faster and run smoother.
- **Learning:** Coding without frameworks deepens my understanding of the web's core technologies.
- **Portability:** Projects can be easily shared, hosted, or reused anywhere.
- **Fun:** There's a unique satisfaction in building things from the ground up.
